Users:

Windows: Make sure Bluetooth is ON and Just run the run_sesame_server.exe file.

If you'd like to startup the server on boot, follow instructions at http://windows7themes.net/en-us/where-is-the-startup-folder-on-windows-8-1-and-how-to-add-new-items-to-it/

for linux and mac you would need jre 6 or higher.

Linux:
Make sure Bluetooth is ON and Just Run the startup.bash script.
If you'd like to start sesame server automatically, include following lines in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc

#!/bin/bash
startup_dir="DIRECTORY NAME WHERE SESAME startup.bash etc. files are located"

if [ -f $startup_dir/startup.bash ]; then
   cd $startup_dir
   bash $startup_dir/startup.bash
   cd -
fi


Mac 
Make sure Bluetooth is ON and simply double click Run_Sesame_Server.jar to start the sesameserver
If you get a exception saying the jar crashed, it is probably because bluetooth is OFF.

If you'd like to start sesame server automatically, include following lines in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc

#!/bin/bash
startup_dir="DIRECTORY NAME WHERE SESAME startup.bash etc. files are located"

if [ -f $startup_dir/startup.bash ]; then
   cd $startup_dir
   bash $startup_dir/startup.bash
   cd -
fi
